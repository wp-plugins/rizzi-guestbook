Rizzi Guestbook is a guestbook that is simple to administrate and easy to use, while still maintaining
the necessary functionality a guestbook needs.  It is probably the easiest guestbook to use ever created. This guestbook
utilizes the built in comment feature of WordPress which makes the management of your guestbook a breeze.  It
also works great as a testimonial page.
 
 
== Description ==
 
There are several guestbook options for WordPress, but many of them are
extremely complicated, not user friendly, have incompatibility issues, and the list goes on and on.
**Rizzi Guestbook is different.** The purpose for this plugin was to create a
Guestbook that is simple to administrate and easy to use, while still maintaining
the necessary functionality a Guestbook needs. It is probably the easiest guestbook to use ever created.
I hope you find this Guestbook useful.
 
Rizzi Guestbook is a modified and improved version of the WP-ViperGB plugin.
The plugin's listing page was beautifully redesigned, unnecessary features were
removed to increase simplicity, mobile support was added, and many more display features were implemented. It
utilizes the built in comment feature of WordPress which makes the management of your guestbook a breeze.

Features:
 
* Create user-friendly guestbooks without writing a single line of code.
* Option to add a date stamp so you know when people signed your guestbook.
* Allow anyone to sign your guestbook or limit it just to users.
* Lives in a standard WordPress page and uses comments for entries, so moderation and antispam functionality works as normal.
* Two-View layout provides one view for submitting entries and another for reading them.
* Automatic paging of entries to customizable length.
* Compatible with mobile themes.
* No custom database tables are required.
* Simplistic design makes it extremely user friendly.
* Very easy to set up and administrate.
